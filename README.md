apps to budget what I eat and how much it costs me

To show that I while teaching myself best practices I started this project.

I wanted to create something useful for myself as i am a bit over weight I decided to start counting calories and prepare food in advance to keep myself
from getting takeout food.

My first initial project was pure python and it simply creates a recipe and then when time come to buy the ingredients I could select the recipes I want 
to eat in the month and it would complie a shopping list based off of the ingredients required
